# 3d_coverage_control
Implementation of Lloyd's algorithm for multi-agent coverage control in 3D.

Thanks to [Alessia Benevento](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=us-LVKQAAAAJ&hl=en) for the first version of this code, based on the 2D implementation available in the [swarm_sim](https://github.com/gnotomista/swarm_sim) repository.

The code to compute bounded Voronoi cells in 3D is from [this](https://github.com/hyongju/Polytope-bounded-Voronoi-diagram) repository.

Additional utils from MATLAB Central File Exchange are used to draw [Platonic solids](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/77446-platonic-solids) and compute [permutations](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7147-permn).
